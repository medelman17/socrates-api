  "In a decision dated June 28, 2004, an Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s applications for asylum and related relief and ordered her removed from the United States. 1 We dismissed the respondent’s appeal on October 27, 2005, and we denied her motion to reconsider our decision and reopen the proceedings on December 22, 2005. The respondent filed a second motion to reopen on November 12, 2019. The motion will be denied. The respondent is a native and citizen of the People’s Republic of China. In proceedings before the Immigration Judge, she conceded that she is removable, and she applied for relief from removal. The Immigration Judge found that the respondent’s testimony was not credible and, after advising her of the adverse consequences of knowingly filing a frivolous asylum application, determined that “material elements” of her claim were “deliberately fabricated,” as required for a frivolousness finding under 8 C.F.R. § 1208.20 (2004). The respondent’s first attorney who represented her at trial timely appealed that ruling, alleging as one of the four reasons for the appeal that the “Immigration Judge erred in finding the Respondent’s application to be frivolous as it was not fabricated.” The respondent’s second counsel prepared and filed the respondent’s appellate brief, which did not address the frivolous application finding. We dismissed the respondent’s appeal, and specifically affirmed the Immigration Judge’s determinations that she lacked credibility and submitted a frivolous application for asylum. A third counsel filed a petition for review of our decision, which the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit denied on December 18, 2006. 3 Zhou v. Att’y Gen. of U.S., 206 F. App’x 237, 239 (3d Cir. 2006). Quoting the Immigration Judge’s finding that the respondent’s asylum application was frivolous, the court concluded that there was “no basis to reject the findings of either the [Immigration Judge] or the [Board].” Id.";
